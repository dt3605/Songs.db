The audio aura of the listener from this dataset can be characterized by the general mood, energy, and danceability of their top 100 songs. For example, if most songs have high energy and valence, the listener prefers upbeat and positive music.

However, this calculation may not be fully representative because it only considers the top 100 streamed songs, ignoring genres, lesser-streamed favorites, and context in which songs are played.

A better approach would include analyzing listening habits across different times, playlists, and user interactions to get a more complete representation of the listener's preferences.
